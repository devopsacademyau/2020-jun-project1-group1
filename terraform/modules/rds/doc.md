## Module responsible for handling the database

For now, until other modules are ready, I had to implement a few resources myself. These resources will later be created by different modules.

### TODO:

- replace module VPC by the project's main VPC
- replace the module subnets by the project's subnets
- update security group rules accordingly
- implement random passwords with SSM
