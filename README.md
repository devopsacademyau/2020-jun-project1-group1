## About The Project
This project aims to move a web application from on-premise to a cloud-hosted solution.

Currently, the WordPress-based application uses LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) and the solution is hosted in a single server (application and database) where the deployments are made through FTP transfers to the server.

This cloud migration is designed to comply with the following requirements:

- The application must be containerized;
- The application must to be secure (all data encrypted at rest and in transit)
- The application must to be highly available.
- The application must to support peaks of up to 10 times the average load (scalability).
- The infrastructure must to be reproducible and version-controlled in case the CEO decides to expand the business to other parts of the world (consider infra as code).
- There must be an easy and secure way of developing, with fast feedback  (consider CI/CD practices or at least automation scripts)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Create a Github account: https://github.com/join

* Create your AWS account: https://aws.amazon.com/free/start-your-free-trial/

* Install AWS cli: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html

* Install Terraform cli: https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html

* Install Docker cli: https://docs.docker.com/install/

* Install Make: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/index.html#toc-Overview-of-make

## Usage

> üî•üî•üî• **TL;DR;** üî•üî•üî•<br />
> GRAB THE POPCORN üçø <br />
> RUN **`make kick-n-run` (docker daemon must be running)**<br />
> ENJOY THE SHOW üòé üé¶ 

**Clone or download the repository to your machine:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devopsacademyau/2020-jun-project1-group1.git
```

**Set up your AWS credentials:** 

```bash
aws configure
```

 **Decide on where you want the terraform state files to be stored. local is fine, but s3 is recommened (https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html)** 

```bash
vim ./terraform/_backend.tf
```

 **Review and update the main.tfvars file with your variables**

```bash
vim ./terraform/main.tfvars
```

**(Optional) plan the terraform build**

```bash
make tf-ci-plan
```

**Run below from your root directory**

```bash
make kick-n-run
```

**Destroy the infrastructure**

```
make tf-ci-remove
```

<!-- HOW TO'S -->

## How To's

### Initiate the infrastructure

- Run [`make tf-all`](docs/scripts.md#tf-all)

> it will create the infrastructure commands only, it will not push the wordpress docker image.

***Quickest way:***

- Run [`make kick-n-run`](docs/scripts.md#kick-n-run)

## Update the docker image in the ECR

- Run [`make update-wp`](docs/scripts.md#update-wp)

### Deploy a new docker image to the ECS

- Run [`make deploy-wp`](docs/scripts.md#deploy-wp)

### Remove the resources created

- Run [`make tf-ci-remove`](docs/scripts.md#tf-ci-remove)

### Change the name of the project

- Edit [main.tfvars](terraform/main.tfvars) file and change the variable `project`.
- Edit `.env` file in the root directory (create if doens't exists) and change the variable `PROJECT_NAME`

### Change the name of the ECR repository

- Edit [main.tfvars](terraform/main.tfvars) and change the variable `repository_name`.
- Edit `.env` file in the root directory (create if doens't exists) and change the variable `DOCKER_REPOSITORY`

### Change the ECR repository location to another AWS account

- Edit `.env` file in the root directory (create if doens't exists) and change the variable `DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL`
